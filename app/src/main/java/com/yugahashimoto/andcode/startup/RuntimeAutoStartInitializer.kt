/**
 * Runs once per process, via [androidx.startup.AppInitializer], to bring the local runtime's
 * ancillary state in line with whatever is already running: syncing the onboarding-completed
 * flag, selecting the runtime once it is [Ready][LocalRuntimeStatus.Ready] if nothing else was
 * chosen, restoring the wireless-debugging link, and warming the provider catalog.
 *
 * It used to also *start* the runtime itself, via [restoreIfConfigured] with
 * [RuntimeAutoStartTrigger.AppLaunch] - but this runs for every process the OS ever creates for the
 * app, including the UI-less one `BOOT_COMPLETED` spins up, which made
 * [RuntimeAutoStartTrigger.BootOrPackageReplaced] refusing that trigger in
 * [RuntimeAutoStartReceiver] pointless: this initializer restarted the runtime a moment later in the
 * very same process anyway. That responsibility now lives solely in
 * [com.yugahashimoto.andcode.AndCodeApplication]'s foreground observer, which only ever sees `true`
 * for an actual activity coming on screen - never for a broadcast-only process.
 *
 * [syncOnboardingCompleted] did *not* move with it, even though it went along for the ride in the
 * previous round: [create] runs synchronously on the main thread, after `LAUNCH_ACTIVITY` but
 * before the first Choreographer frame, so it is the only place that can guarantee the flag is
 * settled before `ui/AndCodeApp.kt`'s `remember { if (settings.onboardingCompleted) ... }` picks
 * the start destination. The foreground observer's own call to it (needed for a later return, not
 * cold start) runs on `Dispatchers.IO` and would otherwise race that first composition.
